# People
The idea with people is to define any packages and configs to be used for a particular username.

For instance, everone in a Ruby project may want Ruby and rvm setup. But Dennis may also want:

* zsh
* emacs
* terminator

This is place to define that.

### Username
When the profile tool is run by this user it sets up everything defined in this file.

### Packages
Just like packages anywhere else

### Configs
Paths to template files for dotfiles.
